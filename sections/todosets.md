To-do sets
==========

All to-do lists under a Basecamp are children of a to-do set resource.

Endpoints:

- [Get to-do sets](#get-to-do-sets)
- [Get to-do set](#get-to-do-set)
- [Hide to-dos tool](#hide-to-dos-tool)

Get to-do sets
--------------

* `GET /buckets/1/todosets.json` will return an array, with the first entry being the to-do set for the Basecamp with an ID of `1`.

This payload includes the first 10 todolists in the `todolists` key. To retrieve more, see the [Get to-do lists][1] endpoint.
