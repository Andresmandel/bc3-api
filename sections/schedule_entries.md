Create a schedule entry
-----------------------

* `POST /buckets/1/schedules/3/entries.json` creates a schedule entry in the Basecamp with ID `1` and under the schedule with an ID of `3`.

**Required parameters**:

* `summary` - what this schedule entry is about
* `starts_at` - timestamp for when this schedule entry begins
* `ends_at` - timestamp for when this schedule entry ends

_Optional parameters_:

* `description_html` - containing more information about the schedule entry. See our [Rich content][rich] guide for what HTML tags allowed.
* `participant_ids` - an array of people IDs that will participate in this entry. Please see the [Get people][people] endpoints to retrieve them.
* `all_day` - when set to `true`, the schedule entry will not have a specific start or end time, and instead will be held for the entire day or days denoted in `starts_at` and `ends_at`
* `notify` - when set to `true`, will notify the participants about the entry

This endpoint will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the schedule entry if the creation was a success. See the [Get a schedule entry](#get-a-schedule-entry) endpoint for more info on the payload.
