```


Create a Basecamp
-----------------

* `POST /projects.json` with at least a name, and optionally a description, to kick off a new Basecamp.

###### Example JSON Request

``` json
{
  "name": "Marketing Campaign",
  "description": "For Client: Xyz Corp Conference"
}
```

This will return `201 Created` with the current JSON representation of the Basecamp if the creation was a success. See the [Get a Basecamp](#get-a-basecamp) endpoint for more info. If your the account is on a free subscription and you're trying to create a new Basecamp you'll see a `507 Insufficient Storage` and a response of:

``` json
{
  "error": "The Basecamp limit for this account has been reached."
}
```

If you hit that error, the user will need to upgrade their subscription to any plan, which all have unlimited Basecamps. After creating a Basecamp, you'll  want to [allow people to get in][1]. Or maybe, [add some to-dos][2]!

###### Copy as cURL

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Marketing Campaign","description":"For Client: Xyz Corp Conference"}' \
  https://3.basecamp.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/projects.json
```


Update a Basecamp
-----------------

* `PUT /projects/1.json` will allow updating of a Basecamp's name and description.

###### Example JSON Request

``` json
{
  "name": "Marketing Campaign for Xyz Corp",
  "description": "2016-2017 Strategy"
}
```

This will return `200 OK` with the current JSON representation of the Basecamp if the update was a success. See the [Get a Basecamp](#get-a-basecamp) endpoint for more info.

###### Copy as cURL

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Marketing Campaign for Xyz Corp","description":"2016-2017 Strategy"}' -X PUT \
  https://3.basecamp.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/projects/2085958506.json
```


Trash a Basecamp
----------------

* `DELETE /projects/1.json` will mark the Basecamp with the given ID as trashed.

Trashed Basecamps will be deleted from Basecamp 3 after 30 days. No parameters required. Returns `204 No Content` if successful.

###### Copy as cURL

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE \
  https://3.basecamp.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/projects/2085958507.json
