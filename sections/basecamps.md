Get a basecamp
--------------

* `GET /basecamps/1.json` will return the basecamp with the given ID, granted they have access to it.


``` json

   "bookmark_url" : "https://3.basecamp.com/195539477/my/bookmarks/BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSIrZ2lkOi8vYmMzL0J1Y2tldC8yMDg1OTU4NDk2P2V4cGlyZXNfaW4GOwBUSSIMcHVycG9zZQY7AFRJIg1yZWFkYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--456eaced982bc4da97ac830c019a4af1d250bb21",

}
```

###### Copy as cURL:

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" https://3.basecamp.com/$ACCOUNT_ID/basecamps/1.json
```


Create a basecamp
-----------------

* `POST /basecamps.json` with at least a name, and optionally a description, to kick off a new basecamp.

``` json
{
  "name": "Marketing Campaign",
  "description": "For Client: Xyz Corp Conference"
}
```

This will return `201 Created`, with the location of the new basecamp in the `Location` header along with the current JSON representation of the basecamp if the creation was a success. See the [Get a basecamp](#get-a-basecamp) endpoint for more info. If the account has reached the basecamp limit you'll see a `507 Insufficient Storage` and a response of:

``` json
{
  "error": "The basecamp limit for this account has been reached."
}
```

If you hit that error, you'll need to either archive or trash projects, or upgrade your subscription to a bigger plan. After creating a basecamp, you'll  want to [allow people to get in][1]. Or maybe, [add some to-dos][2]?

###### Copy as cURL:

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Marketing Campaign","description":"For Client: Xyz Corp Conference"}' \
  http://bc3.dev/$ACCOUNT_ID/basecamps.json
```


Update a basecamp
-----------------

* `PUT /basecamps/1.json` will allow updating of a basecamp's name and description.

``` json
{
  "name": "Marketing Campaign for Xyz Corp",
  "description": "2016-2017 Strategy"
}
```

This will return `200 OK`, with the location of the new basecamp in the `Location` header along with the current JSON representation of the basecamp if the update was a success. See the [Get a basecamp](#get-a-basecamp) endpoint for more info.

###### Copy as cURL:

``` shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Marketing Campaign for Xyz Corp","description":"2016-2017 Strategy"}' -X PUT \
  http://bc3.dev/$ACCOUNT_ID/basecamps/2085958506.json
```


Archive a basecamp
------------------

* `PUT /basecamps/1/archive.json` will archive the basecamp with the given ID. Archived basecamps do not count against the current basecamp limit for an account.


Trash a basecamp
----------------

* `PUT /basecamps/1/trash.json` will mark the basecamp with the given ID as trashed. Trashed basecamps will be deleted from Basecamp 3 after 30 days.


Activate a basecamp
------------------

* `PUT /basecamps/1/active.json` will mark the basecamp as active, removing it from the trashed or archived state.
